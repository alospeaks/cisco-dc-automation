16. press "i" to insert
17. Add the following lines at the end of this file:
    ```
    serial0.present = "TRUE"
    serial0.fileType = "network"
    serial0.fileName = "telnet://127.0.0.1:9002"
    serial0.startConnected = "TRUE"
    serial0.yieldOnMsrRead = "TRUE"
    ```
18. Start VMware Fusion

## Connecting to you NXOSv switch and configuring it.
1. open up a terminal window
2. type `telnet 127.0.0.1 9002`
3. This gives you console access to your nxosv switch.
4. You should see the initial POAP boot screen. Set you admin password and do the initial configuration. (admin/cisco)  
 ![nxosv](/images/nxosv-v-11.png)  
5. Provision the management interface.
    ```
    config t
    inter mgmt0
    ip addr dhcp
    ```
5. Set the boot variable
    `boot nxos bootflash:xosv-final.7.0.3.I2.2e.bin`

6. Enable feature features
    ```
    feature nxapi
    feature scp-server
    ```
6. Save the configuraiton
    `copy run start`
7. checkpoint your configuration
    `checkpoint file bootflash:startconfig`

7. Find out the ip address of the mgmt interfaces.
    `show ip int brief vrf mgmt`
    note down this ip.  now you can ssh to the box via ssh

*Tip*
If you want to rollback your configuration, use
`rollback running-config file bootflash:startconfig`

##Connect to the switch using ssh and http
From a new terminal window, ssh to the ip address of your NXOSv switch.  There is no port forwarding configured but the switch ip address is visible on the host.
`ssh  admin@172.16.123.134`
Set the default gateway. (You can get the default gateway ip from your mac. type ifconfig and look for the ip address of vmnet8.)
```
switch(config)# vrf context management
switch(config-vrf)# ip route 0/0 172.16.123.1
```
You can access the sandbox by going to the  following address:    http://172.16.123.134

##Troubleshooting
If you get into loader mode, use these commands to recover.

On the VMware Fusion Console window
type `dir`
note down the image name

`loader> boot <put the image name here>`

Introduction
-----
Jenkins is an open source tool that is used for scheduling and running automated tests and deployment.  It is essentially the friendly butler of automation who will handle all of your automation tasks for you once you tell him to do so and he only needs to be told once.

In the Server world, Jenkins can be used to perform the typical build server work, such as doing continuous/official/nightly builds, run tests, or perform some repetitive batch tasks.

### Exercise-1
#### Update the hosts file
1. Open another terminal window and navigate to training folder
2. source `source source.docker`
3. Find out the ip address of your `nxosv` switch.  you can login into the switch and type `show ip int brief vrf  management`.  Note down the ip.
4. Update the hosts files on the jenkins server  since we are not using dns
5. type

	`docker exec -it jenkins /bin/sh -c "echo 172.16.123.135 n9k-1 > /etc/hosts"`

6. repeat this for all the switches you have.

### Exercise-2
#### Getting Jenkins login password
1. Get the admin password
	3. type `docker exec -it jenkins  cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword `
	4. copy the password
	5. type `docker-machine ip default` and note down the ip address of the docker host

### Exercise-3
#### Login into Jenkins Server
6. Open up a chrome browser and login in.
7. `http://<ip>:8080`
8. type in the admin password that you copied previously.

10. Click `Select plugins to install`. and select none (we will install plugins manually)

11. Select none (we will install plugins manually)

12. Create a user account (<yourid>/cisco123)

13. Click next and then `start using jenkins`


### Exercise-4
#### Installing jenkins plugins

We need gitlab plugin for now.  Lets install them.

1. Go to the dashboard
2. on the left side, click on `Manage Jenkins`
3. On the right side, click on `Manage Plugins`

	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-15.png)
3. Then select plugins
	1. Click on the `Available` plugins
	2. on the `Filter` , type git
	3. Find the following plugin and check the select box.
		1. gitlab plugin

5. Click on `Install without restart`

	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-17.png)

6. Once install, you need to restart your server. Check the `restart box` at the end of the screen or
7. On the url of the browser type `http://<ip>:8080/restart`

### Exercise-5
#### Creating a job
Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML or JSON format and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions in human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and auditing easier

1. Click on `Create new Job`

 	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-jobs-1.png)
3. Name the job `deploy-prod`
4. use `free style project`

	Freestyle project: This provides the ability to create a completely custom job that can behave in any way we choose.

5. Switch to your gitlab tab on the browser.  
	1. Click on the `Project`
	2. copy the url for the `ansible` project.

	![jenkins](/images/gitlab-305.png)

5. Switch back to the jenkins tab.  Fill in the `Source Code Management Form`.

	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-400.png)

7. Set the trigger for the build job.

	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-401.png)

6. Run a shell script to run the ansible playbook.

	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-402.png)

	Make sure to change the playbook name to meet your requirement

	```
	#!/bin/bash
	echo "Running Ansible against: $FQDN"
	# http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/gettingstarted.html#a-note-about-host-key-checking
	export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
	pushd /var/jenkins_home/workspace/deploy-prod/
	    ansible-playbook -i hosts r-baseconfig.yml
	popd

	```
Note: jenkins will fetch the repo and store the contents  under `/var/jenkins_home/workspace/deploy-prod/` directory.

8. Click on `Save`
8. Click on `Build Now`

9. Take a look at the console output.  Click on the build and select `Console Output`

10. Copy the CI integration url so that we can create a webhook in gitlab
	1. Click on the `deploy-prod` job
	2. click on the `Configure`
	3. go down to the `Build Triggers` section
	4. copy the CI service url

	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-403.png)
We will use this information in the next exercise.

### Exercise-6
#### Configure the webhook on the gitlab.
If you like the gitlab notify Jenkins that something has changed in the repo and go deploy it again, you need to configure something called webhook.

1. Switch to back to the `gitlab` tab.
2. Go to `ansible` project
3. Click on `settings` and then select webhook.

	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-404.png)
4. paste the url that you copied from the jenkins page

	![jenkins](/images/jenkins-405.png)
5. Click on `Add Webhook`

6. Click on `Test`.  Make sure you get success.

### Exercise-6
#### Test the automate deployment
Go into your ansible folder and change something.
Push the configuration to gitlab.
Watch the jenkins server and see how it will automatically deploy


### Troubleshooting
**Tips**
Sometime you will need to login into jenkins container to troubleshoot this. Use this method:

`docker exec -u 0 -it jenkins bash`

or

`docker exec -it jenkins /bin/bash`

All the files are under ``/var/jenkins_home/workspace/``  ; your git will be cloned into this directory
